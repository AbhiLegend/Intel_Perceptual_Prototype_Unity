Intel_Perceptual_Prototype_Unity
================================

PROTOTYPE NAME :-CUBEIT

This protype uses gesture as well as Touch attributes to show a User Interface as well as Color changing effect to teach Kids and feel the change

2)It is an interface that will contain Cube game object built in Unity with Intel Perceptual SDK Which uses Support for Touch, Gesture recognition, 2D texture rendering and Webcam capture utilizing 2d text rendering of Intel Perceptual SDK?
     
     
3) My intent was to build it for Ultrabook targeting Windows 8 and Win 7.With Windows 8 the Touch is working perfect.
                    
                    
                    
4) It is highly interactive as it supports Touch, Tap, Gesture, 2D rendering to its full effect.


5) It is a fun app prototype that will teach Kids to learn about colours with touch and tap.



6) The prototype helps user to get a feel on how touch input as well as Gesture Input worksWith Unity and Intel Perceptual SDK. The prototype shows the usage of Intel Perceptual
  SDK and it renders texture as well as uses Creative Gesture Camera to post live view of Camera capture as a Cube object. With Thumbs up gesture the colour of the cubes changes.
   The other cubes uses Touch and Tap to change colours and  we can touch and move the objects.
